# Titanic Survival Rate Prediction 🚢

## Project Overview 📊

This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various passenger features like age, gender, and class, we build a model that can classify whether a passenger survived or not.

## Objective 🎯

- Build a classification model to predict survival based on passenger data.
- Utilize various machine learning algorithms to determine the most accurate model.
- Analyze feature importance to understand the key factors influencing survival.

## Problem Statement 🔍

The Titanic disaster resulted in significant loss of life. The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict survival probabilities for passengers based on features like age, gender, and passenger class. This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to determine whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Dataset 📂

- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
- **Data Description**: 
    - The dataset contains information on 891 passengers with features such as `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, and `Embarked`.
    - The target variable is `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes), which indicates if the passenger survived.

## Key Findings & Results 🏆

- **Model Evaluation** 📈: Various models were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The best model provided an accuracy of approximately 80%, with significant contributions from features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Age`.
- **Performance Metrics** 📊:
  - Accuracy: 80% ✔️
  - Precision: 78% 🎯
  - Recall: 82% 🔍
  - F1-Score: 80% ⚖️

## Next Steps 🔧

- Explore advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks for better performance.
- Experiment with feature engineering to further improve model predictions.
- Analyze survival rates across different classes, genders, and ages to derive actionable insights.
